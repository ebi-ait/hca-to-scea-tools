Investigation Title	Dissecting the human liver cellular landscape by single cell RNA-seq reveals novel intrahepatic monocyte/ macrophage populations																																	
Comment[Submitted Name]	SingleCellLiverLandscape																																	
Experiment Description	The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is critical for metabolic and immune functions. However, little is known about the cells that make up the human liver and its immune microenvironment. Here we report a map of the cellular landscape of the human liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. We provide the transcriptional profiles of 8444 parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells obtained from the fractionation of fresh hepatic tissue from five human livers. Using gene expression patterns, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical examinations, we identify 20 discrete cell populations of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, B cells, conventional and non-conventional T cells, NK-like cells, and distinct intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage populations. Together, our study presents a comprehensive view of the human liver at single-cell resolution that outlines the characteristics of resident cells in the liver, and in particular provides a map of the human hepatic immune microenvironment.

Protocol Description	Resection of the human liver caudate lobe (segment 1) was carried out on the surgical backbench as part of preparation for organ implantation.	Liver homogenate was obtained by Perfusion/Collagenase/Neutral Protease Digestion of the Human Liver Caudate Lobe and filtered through a 70uM filter.	Samples were prepared as outlined by the 10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ v2 Reagent Kit user guide. Samples were washed twice in PBS (Life Technologies) + 0.04% BSA (Sigma) and re-suspended in PBS + 0.04% BSA. Sample viability was assessed via Trypan Blue (Thermo Fisher) and using a haemocytometer (Thermo Fisher). Following counting, the appropriate volume for each sample was calculated for a target capture of 6000 cells. Samples below the required cell concentration as defined by the user guide (i.e., <400 cells/μl) were pelleted and re-suspended in a reduced volume and counted again using a haemocytometer prior to loading onto the 10x Genomics single-cell-A chip. After droplet generation, samples were transferred onto a pre-chilled 96-well plate (Eppendorf), heat-sealed and reverse transcription was performed using a Veriti 96-well thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher). After the reverse transcription, cDNA was recovered using Recovery Agent provided by 10x followed by a Silane DynaBead clean-up (Thermo Fisher) as outlined in the user guide. Purified cDNA was amplified for 12 cycles before being cleaned up using SPRIselect beads (Beckman). Samples were diluted 4:1 (elution buffer (Qiagen): cDNA) and run on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) to determine cDNA concentration. cDNA libraries were prepared as outlined by the Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v2 user guide with appropriate modifications to the PCR cycles based on the calculated cDNA concentration (as recommended by 10X Genomics). The molarity of each library was calculated based on library size as measured using a bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and qPCR amplification data (Kappa/Roche). Samples were pooled and normalized to 10 nM, then diluted to 2 nM using elution buffer (Qiagen) with 0.1% Tween20 (Sigma). Each 2 nM pool was denatured using 0.1 N NaOH at equal volumes for 5 min at room temperature. Library pools were further diluted to 20 pM using HT-1 (Illumina) before being diluted to a final loading concentration of 14 pM. 150 μl from the 14 pM pool was loaded into each well of an 8-well strip tube and loaded onto a cBot (Illumina) for cluster generation.	Samples were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 with the following run parameters: Read 1—26 cycles, read 2—98 cycles, index 1 —8 cycles. A median sequencing depth of 60,000 reads/cell was targeted for each sample.
