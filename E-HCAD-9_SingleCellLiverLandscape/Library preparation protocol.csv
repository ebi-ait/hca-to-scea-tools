ac399b75-3cc1-4bf0-8d19-8c29c2545402;lib_prep_prot_1;Standard 10x v2 chemistry library preparation;Samples were prepared as outlined by the 10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ v2 Reagent Kit user guide. Briefly, the samples were washed twice in PBS (Life Technologies) + 0.04% BSA (Sigma) and re-suspended in PBS + 0.04% BSA. Sample viability was assessed via Trypan Blue (Thermo Fisher) and using a haemocytometer (Thermo Fisher). Following counting, the appropriate volume for each sample was calculated for a target capture of 6000 cells. Samples below the required cell concentration as defined by the user guide (i.e., <400 cells/μl) were pelleted and re-suspended in a reduced volume and counted again using a haemocytometer prior to loading onto the 10x Genomics single-cell-A chip. After droplet generation, samples were transferred onto a pre-chilled 96-well plate (Eppendorf), heat-sealed and reverse transcription was performed using a Veriti 96-well thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher). After the reverse transcription, cDNA was recovered using Recovery Agent provided by 10x followed by a Silane DynaBead clean-up (Thermo Fisher) as outlined in the user guide. Purified cDNA was amplified for 12 cycles before being cleaned up using SPRIselect beads (Beckman). Samples were diluted 4:1 (elution buffer (Qiagen): cDNA) and run on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) to determine cDNA concentration. cDNA libraries were prepared as outlined by the Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v2 user guide with appropriate modifications to the PCR cycles based on the calculated cDNA concentration (as recommended by 10X Genomics).;;;;polyA RNA;OBI:0000869;polyA RNA extract;single cell;10X 3' v2 sequencing;EFO:0009899;10X 3' v2 sequencing;3 prime tag;poly-dT;first;;;
