6d0ddf28-b609-438c-8d80-67719e97d4e5;seq_prot_1;10X_scRNASeq_protocol;The molarity of each library was calculated based on library size as measured using a bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and qPCR amplification data (Kappa/Roche). Samples were pooled and normalized to 10 nM, then diluted to 2 nM using elution buffer (Qiagen) with 0.1% Tween20 (Sigma). Each 2 nM pool was denatured using 0.1 N NaOH at equal volumes for 5 min at room temperature. Library pools were further diluted to 20 pM using HT-1 (Illumina) before being diluted to a final loading concentration of 14 pM. 150 μl from the 14 pM pool was loaded into each well of an 8-well strip tube and loaded onto a cBot (Illumina) for cluster generation. Samples were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 with the following run parameters: Read 1—26 cycles, read 2—98 cycles, index 1 —8 cycles. A median sequencing depth of 60,000 reads/cell was targeted for each sample.;;;;Illumina HiSeq 2500;EFO:0008565;Illumina HiSeq 2500;;no;3' end single cell RNA sequencing;EFO:0008440;tag based single cell RNA sequencing;bcl2fastq;v2.19.1;;
