Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	nucleic acid library construction protocol	nucleic acid sequencing protocol							
Protocol Name	P-HCAD25-1	P-HCAD25-2	P-HCAD25-3							
Protocol Description	Five human donor brain samples were selected from the Oxford Brain Bank. Blocks of approximately 3 mm2 were dissected from snap-frozen slices from the central portion of the Substantia nigra at the level of the third nerve encompassing both ventral and dorsal tiers and from the middle frontal gyrus encompassing the cortex but macroscopically excluding the subcortical white matter.	10x Chromium single nuclei sequencing was performed directly on the dissected cortex and substantia nigra (SN) region samples from five individuals. A modified version of the published 10X Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3 User Guide was used for single-cell RNA Sequencing library preparation.	Sequencing of single-cell RNA sequencing libraries was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine.							
Protocol Hardware			Illumina HiSeq 4000
