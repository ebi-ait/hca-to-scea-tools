Investigation Title	A single-cell reference map of transcriptional states for human blood and tissue T cell activation
Comment[Submitted Name]	HumanTissueTcellActivation
Experiment Description	Human T cells coordinate adaptive immunity in diverse anatomic compartments through production of cytokines and effector molecules, but it is unclear how tissue site influences T cell persistence and function. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of >50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease.

Protocol Description	Lungs were flushed with cold complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine) and left lateral basal segment of the lung was isolated. After dissociation and enrichment, 0.5 – 1x106 CD3+ enriched cells were cultured in complete medium for 16 hours at 37°C. After 16 hours, dead cells were removed with a dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi 130-090-101).

After dissociation and enrichment, 0.5 – 1x106 CD3+ enriched cells were cultured in complete medium for 16 hours at 37°C with TCR stimulation using Human CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (STEMCELL Technologies 10991). After 16 hours, dead cells were removed with a dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi 130-090-101).	BM was aspirated from the superior iliac crest.
