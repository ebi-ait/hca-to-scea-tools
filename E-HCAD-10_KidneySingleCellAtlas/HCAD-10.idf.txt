Investigation Title	Spatio-temporal immune zonation of the human kidney
Comment[Submitted Name]	KidneySingleCellAtlas
Experiment Description	Tissue-resident immune cells are important for organ homeostasis and defense. The epithelium may contribute to these functions directly, or via crosstalk with immune cells. We resolved the spatio-temporal immune topology of the human kidney with a scRNAseq dataset from 40,268 mature and 27,203 fetal kidney cells. Within the epithelial compartment there were zonated patterns of immune gene expression, with pelvic epithelial anti-microbial peptide expression in mature but not fetal kidneys. Tissue-resident immune cells were evident in both fetal and mature kidney, with post-natal acquisition of infection-defense capabilities. Epithelial-immune signalling orchestrated localization of macrophages and neutrophils to regions of the kidney susceptible to infection.

Protocol Description	Fetal material was obtained from both medical (pharmacologically induced) and surgical termination of pregnancy. 	Isolated fetal kidneys were cut into into <1mm3 segments and digested with 1.6mg/mL collagenase type IV (Worthington) in RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37 °C with intermittent shaking. The suspension was passed through a 100 μm filter and then treated with 1X RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 5 minutes at room temperature and washed once with flow buffer (PBS containing 5%(v/v) FBS and 2mM EDTA) prior to staining. 	Protocol for live and CD45+/- enrichment in fetal kidney samples	Protocol for live and CD45+/- enrichment in fetal kidney samples	Single cell suspensions were counted using an haemocytometer and adjusted to 1000 cells/uL (mature samples) or 400-800 cells/uL (fetal samples). Cells were loaded according to the standard protocol of the Chromium single cell 3’ kit to capture between 5000-10000 cells/channel. Version 2 chemistry was used. 	Protocol for sequencing
Protocol Hardware						Illumina HiSeq 4000
