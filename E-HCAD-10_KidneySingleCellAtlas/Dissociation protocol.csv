Samples were then processed using a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) on program spleen 4 then lung 2. The suspension was passed through a 100 μm cell strainer (Falcon), and washed with PBS. ;;;Mature_kidney_dissociation.pdf;Enzymatic and mechanical dissociation;EFO:0009128;enzymatic dissociation

The suspension was passed through a 100 μm filter and then treated with 1X RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 5 minutes at room temperature and washed once with flow buffer (PBS containing 5%(v/v) FBS and 2mM EDTA) prior to staining. ;;;Fetal_kidney_dissociation.pdf;Enzymatic and mechanical dissociation;EFO:0009128;enzymatic dissociation
