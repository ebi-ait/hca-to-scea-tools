Investigation Title	Single cell profiling of human induced dendritic cells generated by direct reprogramming of embryonic fibroblasts
Comment[Submitted Name]	Reprogrammed_Dendritic_Cells
Experiment Description	Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells specialized in the recognition, processing and presentation of antigens to T-cells, inducing adaptive immune responses. We have identified PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 transcription factors (TFs)  to reprogram human fibroblasts into DC type 1 (DC1). Induced DCs acquire a step-wise DC1 transcriptional signature at the single cell level as assessed with droplet based scRNA-seq. Hence, we provide evidence that antigen presentation can be dynamically programmed by a small combination of TFs in human cells. Moreover, it represents a platform for generating autologous DC1, the most attractive DC subset for cancer immunotherapy.

Protocol Description	After removal of the central nervous system, spinal ganglia and internal organs, residual embryonic tissue was transferred several times to a clean petri dish containing sterile cold hibernation medium to remove contaminant cells. The epidermis was then carefully removed by tearing the tissue with sterile forceps (at this point another set of sterile forceps was employed to avoid cell-contaminants from other organs). Sub-dissected epidermis was washed several times with hibernation medium prior seeding to a 0.1% gelatin-coated flask in HEF medium (DMEM-GlutaMAX, 5% FBS, 1% Sodium Puryvate, 1% Non-essential amino acids) supplemented with 50 ug/ml Gentamicin.		Fibroblasts were dissociated using trypsin to generate a single cell suspension.	PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 (PIB)-transduced human embryonic fibroblasts were FACS sorted and collected at day 3 (CD45+ cells) for single cell profilling. 	PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 (PIB)-transduced human embryonic fibroblasts were FACS sorted and collected at day 9 (CD45+ HLA-DR+ cells) for single cell profilling. 	10x-Genomics v2 libraries were prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions. 	10x-Genomics v2 libraries were sequence on na Ilumina NextSeq according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Protocol Hardware							Illumina NextSeq 500
