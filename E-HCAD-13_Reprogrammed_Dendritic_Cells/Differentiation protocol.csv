Cells were incubated overnight with a ratio of 1:1 FUW-TetO-PIB (policistronic plasmid encoding the reprogramming factors PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3) and FUW-M2rtTA lentiviral particles in media supplemented with 8 μg/mL polybrene. Cells were transduced twice in consecutive days and media replaced in between. After the second transduction, growth media was supplemented with Doxycycline (Dox; 1 μg/mL) and this was considered day 0. Media was changed every 2-3 days for the duration of the cultures.
