## Definitions

**Factor values**

A factor value is a chosen experimental characteristic which can be used to group or differentiate samples. Multiple factor values can be entered and should be chosen from the following list.

- Known disease(s)
- Development stage
- Sampling time point
- Organ
- Organ part
- Selected cell type(s)
- Individual

There must be at least 1 factor value. If you cannot identify a factor value i.e. all donors and samples share the same metadata with respect to the above list of factor values, then enter 'Individual'.

**Experiment type**

An experiment with samples which can be grouped or differentiatied by a factor value is classified as 'differential'. The list of possible factor values can be found above.

If 1 or more factor values other than 'Individual' is identified, then the experiment type should be 'Differential'. If the only factor value is 'Individual', then the experiment type should be 'Baseline'.

## Developer Notes

### Developing Code in Editable Mode

Using `pip`'s editable mode, projects using hca-to-scea as a dependency can refer to the latest code in this repository 
directly without installing it through PyPI. This can be done either by manually cloning the code
base:

    pip install -e path/to/hca-to-scea

or by having `pip` do it automatically by providing a reference to this repository:

    pip install -e \
    git+https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-to-scea-tools.git\
    #egg=hca-to-scea
    
    
### Publish to PyPI

1. Create PyPI Account through the [registration page](https://pypi.org/account/register/).
    
   Take note that PyPI requires email addresses to be verified before publishing.

2. Package the project for distribution.
 
        python setup.py sdist
    
3. Install [Twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/)

        pip install twine        
    
4. Upload the distribution package to PyPI. 

        twine upload dist/*
        
    Running `python setup.py sdist` will create a package in the `dist` directory of the project
    base directory.
