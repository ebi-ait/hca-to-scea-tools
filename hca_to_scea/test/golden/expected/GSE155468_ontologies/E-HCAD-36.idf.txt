Investigation Title	Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals dynamic cell populations and differential gene expression patterns in control and aneurysmal human aortic tissue																
Comment[Submitted Name]	AneurysmalHumanAorticTissue																
Experiment Description	To improve understanding of Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) pathogenesis, the authors sought to comprehensively characterise the cellular composition of the ascending aortic wall and to identify molecular alterations in each cell population of human ATAA tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing technology.

Protocol Description	Control ascending aortic tissue samples were obtained from recipients of heart transplants or lung donors during surgery. Diseased aortic tissue samples were obtained from patients with sporadic ATAA during surgery.	A piece of aortic tissue (1-2 cm2) was separated into thin layers and cut into small pieces in Hanks’ balanced salt solution with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Small pieces of tissue were placed in an enzyme cocktail prepared with 3 mg/ml collagenase type II, 0.15 mg/ml collagenase type XI, 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1875 mg/ml elastase lyophilized, 0.24 mg/ml hyaluronidase type I, and 2.38 mg/ml 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid in HBSS and were digested in a 37°C water bath for 1 to 2 hours.	Cell suspensions were collected by using a 40-mm cell strainer, centrifuged at 300 g for 10 minutes, and resuspended in HBSS with 5% FBS.	Libraries were constructed following the instructions of Chromium Single Cell 3' v2 Reagent Kits user guide.	Libraries were constructed following the instructions of Chromium Single Cell 3' v3 Reagent Kits user guide.	Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. instrument.											
Protocol Hardware						Illumina NovaSeq 6000
