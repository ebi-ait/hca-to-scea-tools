Investigation Title	Colonic single epithelial cell census reveals goblet cell drivers of barrier breakdown in inflammatory bowel disease.
Comment[Submitted Name]	EpithelialDiversityHealthInflammation
Experiment Description	Three single cell RNA-sequencing (10x, Chromium) experiments were performed on healthy and inflamed human colonic samples, including from patients with Ulcerative Colitis. The authors characterised the composition of the intestinal epithelial cells in these samples.

Protocol Description	Following informed consent, biopsies were collected from volunteers attending endoscopy for routine colonoscopic screening (healthy individuals), or as part of ongoing clinical care (patients with IBD). For ulcerative colitis, we used tissue derived from immunotherapy-naive patients with a proven histological diagnosis. Tissue was sampled from clinically inflamed distal colons and proximal clinically noninvolved regions.		Single cell RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Single Cell 3′ library and Gel Bead Kit v.2 and as described in the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics User Guide, Revision B). Cells were loaded onto the 10X Chromium Single Cell Platform (10X Genomics) at a concentration of 1,000 cells per µl. 		Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument using 150-base-pair paired-end reads.
