Briefly, single cells were partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bread-In-Emulsions in the Chromium controller. After dissolution of the Gel beads in GEMS, the primers were released, and mRNA were reverse transcribed into a barcoded cDNA library. After further clean-up and amplification, the cDNA was enzymatically fragmented and 3' end fragments were selected for library preparation. After further end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation and PCR amplification, sample index, UMI sequences, barcode sequences and sequencing primer P5 and P7 on both ends were added to cDNA.	library_protocol_1	library preparation protocol 1										first	10.0	16.0	Read 1			data:3494	DNA sequence	DNA sequence		https://sra-downloadb.st-va.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sos1/sra-pub-run-16/SRR9290718/SRR9290718.1		sra	SRR9290718	6.0	6.0		read1					Cellranger			EFO:0008563	Illumina HiSeq 4000	Illumina HiSeq 4000		EFO:0008440	tag based single cell RNA sequencing	tag based single cell RNA sequencing	no		Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument.	sequencing_protocol_1	sequencing protocol 1				Microdissected region from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse hearts; Zone III BB/PF region (Right Ventricle)	SAMN12046030	Zone III (Right): BB/PF region (Right Ventricle)	SAMN12046030	wild-type	SRS4961566	10090.0			PATO:0000461	normal	normal	NCBITaxon:10090	Mus musculus	Mus musculus	UBERON:0000948	heart	Heart	UBERON:0002080||UBERON:0005987	heart right ventricle||right branch of atrioventricular bundle	BB/PF region luminal side of right ventricle																					dissociation_protocol_1	1	['dissociation_protocol_1']
