Investigation Title	Single-cell Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Dynamic Cell Populations and Differential Gene Expression Patterns in Control and Aneurysmal Human Aortic Tissue.
Comment[Submitted Name]	AneurysmalHumanAorticTissue
Experiment Description	Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is caused by the progressive weakening and dilatation of the aortic wall and can lead to aortic dissection, rupture, and other life-threatening complications. To improve understanding of ATAA pathogenesis, the authors sought to comprehensively characterize the cellular composition of the ascending aortic wall and to identify molecular alterations in each cell population of human ATAA tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing technology.

Protocol Description	Control ascending aortic tissue samples were obtained from recipients of heart transplants or lung donors during surgery. Diseased aortic tissue samples were obtained from patients with sporadic ATAA during surgery.	For each sample, a piece of aortic tissue (1-2 cm2) was separated into thin layers and cut into small pieces in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS, without Ca2+ and Mg2+) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Small pieces of tissue were then placed in an enzyme cocktail prepared with 3 mg/ml collagenase type II, 0.15 mg/ml collagenase type XI, 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1875 mg/ml elastase lyophilized, 0.24 mg/ml hyaluronidase type I, and 2.38 mg/ml 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid in HBSS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and were digested in a 37°C water bath for 1 to 2 hours.	Cell suspensions were collected by using a 40-mm cell strainer ,centrifuged at 300 g for 10 minutes, and resuspended in HBSS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) with 5% FBS, followed with incubation on ice for 30 minutes.	Cells were stained using a live and dead cell kit (L3224, Thermo Fisher) and live singlet cells were sorted by flow cytometry (BD).	Libraries were constructed following the instructions of Chromium Single Cell 3' v2 Reagent Kits user guide.	Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
