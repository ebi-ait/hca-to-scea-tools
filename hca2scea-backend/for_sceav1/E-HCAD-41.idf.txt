Protocol Description	Wild-type outbred CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River. Mice were housed under standard conditions and provided chow and water ad libitum. All experimental procedures followed the guidelines and recommendations of Swedish animal protection legislation and were approved by the local ethical committee for experiments on laboratory animals (Stockholms Norra Djurförsöksetiska nämnd, Sweden). Mice were sacrificed with an overdose of isoflurane, followed by transcardial perfusion with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, in mM: 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 75 sucrose, 20 glucose, 1 CaCl2, 7 MgSO4). The brain was removed, 300μm vibratome sections collected and the regions of interest microdissected under a stereo microscope with a cooled platform. 	CD-1 mice were sacrificed and tissues of interest collected in freshly oxygenated, ice cold aCSF (see above). Sympathetic (SG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were dissected and dissociated as described before (Furlan et al., 2016), with minor modifications.		Tissue pieces were dissociated using the Worthington Papain kit, with 25-35 min enzymatic digestion.	Following dissection, the ganglia was transferred into a 3cm plastic dish with 2.7ml of pre heated (37°C) digestion solution (400μl TrypLE Express (Life Technologies), 2000μl Papain (Worthington; 25U/ml in aCSF), 100μl DNase I (Worthington; 1mM in aCSF) and 200μl Collagenase/Dispase (Roche; 20mg/ml in CS)). Non-ganglia tissue was removed from the ganglia.	Dissociation of the spinal cord followed the procedure described in Häring et al., 2018. In short, following the isolation of gray matter (from cervical to sacral levels), the tissue was transferred into a 3cm plastic dish with 2.5ml of pre heated (37°C) digestion solution (300μl TrypLE Express (Life Technologies), 2000μl Papain (Worthington; 25U/ml in aCSF), 100μl DNase I (Worthington; 1mM in aCSF) and 100μl aCSF. Meninges were removed and the gray matter cut into pieces 1-2mm2.	After 30 min incubation at 37°C, ganglia were triturated with 0.5% BSA-coated glass Pasteur pipette (flamed to 70% of original opening). DRG were also carefully ripped open by using fine forceps to make cells more accessible for the enzymes. This procedure was repeated every 20-30 min using Pasteur pipettes with decreasing diameter appropriate to the dissociation state.	After 30 min incubation at 37°C, pieces were triturated with the first Pasteur pipette (see above). This procedure was repeated every 20min using Pasteur pipettes with decreasing diameter appropriate to the dissociation state.	Dissociated tissue was manually titrated using fire polished Pasteur pipettes and filtered through a 30μm aCSF-equilibrated cell strainer (CellTrics, Sysmex). Cells were then pelleted at 200 g, 5 min, supernatant carefully removed, and resuspended in a minimal volume aCSF. After manually counting cell concentration using a Burker chamber, suspensions were further diluted to desired concentrations.	As soon as all ganglion or spinal cord pieces were dissociated (DRG, SG: ∼1.5-2h; Spinal Cord: 45-60min), the cell suspensions were filtered using a 40μm cell strainer (FALCON) and collected in a 15ml plastic tube. The digestion solution was diluted with 3ml aCSF and centrifuged at 100 g for 4min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 0.5ml aSCF and 0.5ml complete Neurobasal medium (Neurobasal-A supplemented with L-Glutamine, B27 (all GIBCO) and Penicillin/Steptamycin (Sigma)).	The cell suspension was carefully transferred with a Pasteur pipette and layered on top of an Optiprep gradient: 90μl (DRG) or 80μl (SG) Optiprep Density Solution (Sigma) in 455μl aCSF and 455μl complete Neurobasal; and for spinal cord 170μl of Optiprep in 915μl aCSF and 915μl complete Neurobasal. The gradient was centrifuged at 100 g for 10min at 4°C, the supernatant removed until only 100μl remained and 10μl DNaseI added to avoid cell clumping.	Single cell libraries were prepared with 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Kit Version 1.	Single cell libraries were prepared with 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Kit Version 2.	Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina platform. Illumina runs were demultiplexed, aligned to the genome and mRNA molecules were counted using the 10X Genomics cellranger pipeline.
