Protocol Description	All tissue included in this study was provided by the UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank at Imperial College, London, UK and the University of Maryland Brain Bank through the NIH NeuroBioBank. Human MS and control tissues were obtained via a prospective donor scheme following ethical approval by the National Research Ethics Committee in the UK (08/MRE09/31). Snap-frozen Brain tissue blocks were obtained during autopsies of MS patients and 16 controls. Frozen brain tissue samples encompassing the entire span of cortical GM with attached meninges and underlying subcortical WM were sectioned on a CM3050S cryostat (Leica Microsystems) to collect 100 μm-thick sections for total RNA and single nuclei isolation.	40 mg of sectioned brain tissue was homogenized in 5 mL of RNAse-free lysis buffer (0.32M sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MgAc2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100 in DEPC-treated water) using a glass Dounce homogenizer on ice.	Homogenate was loaded into a 30 ml thick polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube. 9 ml of sucrose solution (1.8 M sucrose, 3 mM MgAc2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris-HCl in DEPC-treated water) was added to the bottom of the tube under the homogenate and centrifuged at 107,000 g for 2.5 hours at 4°C. Supernatant was aspirated, and nuclei pellet was incubated in 250 μL of DEPC-treated water-based PBS for 20 min on ice before resuspending the pellet.	The nuclei suspension was diluted to 2,000 nuclei/μL before performing single-nuclei capture using the 10X Genomics Single-Cell 3’ system. 10X nuclei capture and library preparation protocol was carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommendation without modification.	Single-nuclei libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine.
