Investigation Title	Single-cell RNA sequencing of normal human kidney
Comment[Submitted Name]	HumanAdultKidneyLiaoMo
Experiment Description	A comprehensive cellular anatomy of normal human kidney is vital to address the cellular origins of renal disease and renal cancer. Some kidney diseases may be cell type-specific, especially renal tubular cells. To investigate the classification and transcriptomic information of human kidney, we performed a method to obtain single-cell suspension of kidney rapidly, and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We present scRNA-seq data of 22,808 high quality cells from human kidneys of 3 donors. In this dataset, we show 13 clusters of normal human renal cells. Due to the high quality of single cell transcriptomic information, proximal tubule (PT) cells were classified into 6 subtypes and collecting ducts cells into 2 subtypes. Collectively, our data will provide a reliable reference for the studies of renal cell biology and kidney diseases.

Protocol Description	Fresh human kidney samples were collected. Two out of the three samples were obtained from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy, and the remaining sample was from a patient undergoing radical nephroureterectomy. Normal kidney tissues were obtained at least 2 cm away from tumour tissue. First, fresh samples were taken from the operating room and placed in a solution containing Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; WISENT, 311-512-CL) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062) on ice, which was transported to the laboratory within 20 minutes.	0.5–1 g full-thickness sections of kidney tissue were cut lengthwise using surgical scissors. Subsequently, the tissue was washed twice with cold Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. We placed the tissue on a stainless steel cell filter, crushed the tissue with the plunger of a syringe and washed it with DPBS. We added flushing fluid to a centrifuge tube, and collected the kidney fragments into the centrifuge tube, which was then spun at 350 g for 5min at 4 °C; we then repeated this step. Afer discarding the supernatant, we used TrypLETM Express Enzyme to further digest the sticky clumps of cells for 5–10 min at 37 °C, then terminated digestion using Dulbecco’s modifed eagle medium containing 10% fatal bovine serum. The digested cells were centrifuged at 350 g for 5min at 4 °C. After discarding the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of DPBS and filtered through a 100 μm cell strainer. Next, we removed red blood cells using 1X RBC lysis buffer for 5min and centrifuged the cells at 300 g for 5 min at 4 °C. After discarding the supernatant, the cells were suspended in DPBS and centrifuged again.	We used 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagents Kit v2 user guide to perform single cell suspension which were prepared before. Briefly, the single-cell samples were passed through a 40μm cells strainer and counted using a hemocytometer with trypan blue. Subsequently, the appropriate volume for each sample was calculated to recover 10,000 cells. With the 10x protocol, we added the single cells, the Gel Beads and the oils onto the 10x Genomics single-cell-A chip and run this machine. After droplet generation, samples were transferred onto a PCR tube and reverse transcription was performed using T100 Thermal Cycler (BIO-RAD). After the reverse transcription, cDNA was recovered using Recovery Agent provided by 10x genomics followed by a Silane DynaBead clean-up as outlined in the user guide. Purified cDNA was amplified for 10 cycles before being cleaned up by using SPRIselect beads. The samples were detected by Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (invitrogen) to determine cDNA concentration.	Samples were sequenced by Hiseq Xten (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with the following run parameters: read 1 for 150 cycles, read 2 for 150 cycles, index for 14 cycles.
