Protocol Description	Human pancreas Islets were purchased from Prodo Laboratories, Inc. Prodo Laboratories, Inc. obtain donated human pancreases directly from hospitals by delivery under controlled temperature conditions and with appropriate paper work confirming documented informed consent. Human islets are then processed for research. In this study, purchased human pancreas islets were cultured in PIM medium with Human AB Serum (Prodo Laboratories) in 6-well plates with ultralow attachment surface. All cells were cultured at 37°C in Forma Steri-Cycle i160 CO2 Incubator with 5% CO2.	To dissociate islets into single cells, cells were washed once in HBSS and incubated in Accutase at 37°C for 20-25 min. The islets were broken up gently with a 5 mL pipette every 5 min. When > 95% of the islets were digested into single cells, PIM(S) medium were added to neutralize the Accutase. Single cells were washed again with HBSS and resuspended in HBSS at a concentration of 2 × 105/mL for Drop-Seq analysis.	Drop-Seq was performed following the protocol as previously described (Macosko et al., 2015). Briefly, three pump-controlled syringes with cell suspension (200,000 cells/mL), barcoded beads in lysis buffer (200,000 beads/mL), and droplet generation oil were connected to a microfluidic device under microscope supervision. During droplets generation, the cell and bead flow speed was set at 4,000uL/hr, and the oil speed at 15,000uL/hr. The droplets were collected into 50mL falcon tubes (usually less than 5mL). Following droplet breakage, we performed 1st strand cDNA synthesis on beads following the SMART-PCR protocol (Macosko et al., 2015). Finally, the resulting full-length cDNA library was prepared for sequencing.	Sequencing of single-cell RNA sequencing libraries on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine.
