        "description": "Wild-type, timed pregnant CD1 mice were acquired from Jackson Laboratory (Sacramento, CA, USA). Embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), wild-type CD1 mice were obtained from pregnant mice. Embryonic mouse hearts were harvested, and 3 zones of microdissection were isolated based on anatomic landmarks and entailed: Zone I\u2014SAN region (superior vena cava/right atrial junction), Zone II\u2014AVN/His region (crux of heart), and Zone III\u2014BB/PF region (luminal side of ventricles). Specifically, Zone II was dissected as a large area at the crux of the heart from the base of the interatrial sep- tum (including the triangle of Koch) to below the plane of the mitral annulus, from the posterior-most aspect of the heart to the anterior-most. Tissues from a total of 6 different embryos were pooled for each zone of dissection. "

Subsequently, 1.4 mL of collagenase A/B (10 mg/ml) and 20% FBS serum in HBSS was added to the micfocentrifuge tubes and tissue samples were returned to 37 degrees celcius in a waterbath for an additional 20 min. Cells were then spun down at 1000 RPM for 5 min, supernatant was removed and cells werw washed in 20% FBS in HBSS. After suspension, cells were resuspended to around 600 cell/ul with 0.04% FBS/HBSS solution for processing on the 10X platform."

        "description": "Prepared cells were captured with 10X Chromium by following the Chromium single-cell 3' reagent kits v2 user guide. Briefly, single cells were partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bread-In-Emulsions in the Chromium controller. After dissolution of the Gel beads in GEMS, the primers were released, and mRNA were reverse transcribed into a barcoded cDNA library. After further clean-up and amplification, the cDNA was enzymatically fragmented and 3' end fragments were selected for library preparation. After further end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation and PCR amplification, sample index, UMI sequences, barcode sequences and sequencing primer P5 and P7 on both ends were added to cDNA."
