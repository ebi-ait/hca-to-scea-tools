Protocol Name	P-HCAD26-1	P-HCAD26-2	P-HCAD26-3	P-HCAD26-4	P-HCAD26-5		
Protocol Description	Freshly resected renal biopsies were obtained from UConn Health Research Biorepository from patients undergoing kidney nephrectomy for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Only biopsies from 'normal' regions of the kidney were utilised.	Normal kidney resection samples were processed by enzymatic dissociation with Collagenase IV and DNAse for a maximum of 45min.	Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using 10X Genomics 3' version 2 chemistry as per the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.	Single-cell RNA Sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine.			
Protocol Hardware				Illumina HiSeq 4000	NextSeq 500
