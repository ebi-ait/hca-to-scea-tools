Investigation Title	Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the heterogeneity of liver-resident immune cells in human.
Comment[Submitted Name]	HumanLiverImmuneCells_GSE125188
Experiment Description	The liver plays a critical role in both immune defense and tolerance in the body. The liver-resident immune cells (LrICs) determine the immune properties, but the unique composition and heterogeneity of these cells are incompletely understood. Here, we dissect the diversity of LrICs by a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling using unbiased single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Overall design: 10x genomics was used to measure CD45+ immune cells in healthy human liver and paired spleen and PBMCs from the same donors.

Protocol Description	Human peripheral blood (PB) samples used in this study were obtained from three adult donors with liver transplantation with approval from the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, Guangdong province and Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing, China. The written informed consent was obtained from each donor.	Human spleen samples used in this study were obtained from three adult donors with liver transplantation with approval from the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, Guangdong province and Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing, China. The written informed consent was obtained from each donor.	Human liver perfusion (LP) samples used in this study were obtained from three adult donors with liver transplantation with approval from the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, Guangdong province and Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing, China. The written informed consent was obtained from each donor.	PBMCs (n = 26) were isolated by ficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation from heparinized blood of enrolled subjects.	Spleen (n = 15) was first ground on ice and the cells were collected and filtered.	Liver perfusion was directly filtered and concentrated by centrifugation (750g, 15 min, 20 °C), and then layered onto Ficoll.	Human CD45+ cells from liver perfusion, spleen cells, and PBMCs were isolated with the anti-CD45 magnetic-activated cell sorting kit.	The scRNA-Seq libraries were prepared with 10X Genomics Single Cell 3' Reagent Kit v2 following the user guide provided.	Single cell RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq XTEN platform.
