Protocol Description	First-trimester elective termination tissue samples were obtained via manual vacuum aspiration or dilation and curettage. The chorionic villi and decidua were separated using forceps and scissors.	For cell dissociation, tissue samples were incubated in Liberase TL in PBS at 37C for 15 min. The tissue was then manually aspirated using a syringe and needle. Cells were then passed through a Falcon 40-μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min.	Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were prepared according to the standard Drop-seq protocol.	Single cell libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.						
Protocol Hardware				Illumina NextSeq 500 platform
