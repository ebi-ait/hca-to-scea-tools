Investigation Title	Transcriptomic and clonal characterization of T cells in the human central nervous system.
Comment[Submitted Name]	TCellsHumanCentralNervousSystem
Experiment Description	Tissues develop unique homeostatic immune states through specific recruitment of immune cells that are further shaped by the tissue environment. Single-cell RNA of healthy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of brain parenchyma was used to profile the T cell state in the human central nervous system (CNS).

Protocol Description	Flash-frozen human brain tissue was obtained from epilepsy surgery of temporal lobectomy in the Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine. Nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen human brain tissue as previously described (77) with modifications.	Post-mortem unfixed frozen human brain tissues were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Yale School of Medicine. Nuclei were isolated from post-mortem frozen human brain tissue as previously described (77) with modifications.					single-nucleus RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3 chemistry according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics).	Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument.
Protocol Hardware								Illumina HiSeq 4000
