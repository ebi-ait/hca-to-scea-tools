Investigation Title	Population-scale single-cell RNA-seq profiling across dopaminergic neuron differentiation
Comment[Submitted Name]	DopaminergicNeuronDifferentiation
Experiment Description	An efficient pooling strategy was used to differentiate 215 iPS cell lines towards a midbrain neural fate, including dopaminergic neurons. Over 1 million cells were sampled across three differentiation timepoints and profiled using single cell RNA sequencing.

Protocol Description	Healthy human skin tissue samples were donated to the HipSci project.	iPSC colonies were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using Accutase and resuspended in E8 medium containing 10 μM Rock inhibitor.	iPSCs and dissociated organoids were subjected to size selection with a 40 μm cell strainer.	A cell suspension containing an equal amount of each iPSC line was prepared in E8 medium containing 10 μM Rock inhibitor and seeded at 2 x 105 cells per cm2 on 0.01% Geltrex-coated plates. Each pool of lines contained between 7 to 24 donors. 24h after plating, neuronal differentiation of the pooled lines to a midbrain lineage was performed as described by Kriks et al. with minor modifications. Briefly, plated cells were subjected to a modified dual SMAD-inhibition (Chambers et al., 2009) based FP induction protocol (Fasano et al., 2010) based on timed exposure to LDN193189 (100nM), SB431542 (10μM), SAG (100nM), Purmorphamine (2μM), FGF8 (100ng/ml) and CHIR99021(CHIR; 3μM). Cells were cultured in Knockout serum replacement medium (KSR) containing DMEM, 15% knockout serum replacement, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10 μM βmercaptoethanol.	Single cell suspensions were processed by the Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v2. On average, 15,000 cells from each 10x reaction were directly loaded into one inlet of the 10x Genomics chip. All the steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications. iPSCs were processed for scRNA-seq at the indicated time point (day 11, day 30 or day 52). Cerebral organoid derived cells were processed for scRNA-seq after 113 days of culture.	Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument with 50bp or 75bp paired end reads to an average depth of 40,000-60,000 reads per cell.
