Investigation Title	Mapping the immune environment in clear cell renal carcinoma by single-cell genomics
Comment[Submitted Name]	ImmuneRenalCarcinoma
Experiment Description	In order to investigate heterogeneity and dynamics of cancer-associated immune cells, we performed single-cell sequencing on peripheral and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in three renal clear cell carcinoma patients. We chose renal clear cell carcinoma tumors based on the responsive of these tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in the context of low mutational loads, which implies a strong influence from the tumor microenvironment. Using the 10x Genomic 5 expression platform a total of 25,672 immune cells were isolated and passed filtering for quality control, with 13,433 cells from peripheral blood and 12,239 tumor-infiltrating cells. In addition, we used the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J kit to enrich for T cell receptor sequences for nearly 10,000 T cells in with accompanying expression information, allowing for the investigation of clonality and transcriptional phenotypic diversity. We generated a comprehensive immune profile using single-cell RNA-seq data from 25,000 immune cells from three renal cell carcinoma along with matched peripheral blood. In addition, we performed VDJ sequencing on the isolated single T cells. Overall design: T cell receptor sequences of the subset of T cells in the 5' RNA expression sequencing dataset.

Protocol Description	Samples were obtained from the University of Iowa Tissue Procurement Core and GUMER Repository through the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. 	Samples were obtained from the University of Iowa Tissue Procurement Core and GUMER Repository through the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. 	The tumor tissue was cut into pieces of (2–3 mm) in size and transferred to C Tubes (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) containing a mix of Enzymes H, R and A. Mechanical dissociation was accomplished by performing three consecutive automated steps on the gentle MACSTM Dissociator (h_tumor_01, h_tumor_02, and h_tumor_03). 	To allow for enzymatic digestion by Enzymes H, R and A, the C tube was rotated continuously for 30 min at 37 °C, after the first and second mechanical dissociation step. (h_tumor_01, h_tumor_02)	Cells were incubated with FcR blocking reagent (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) for 10 min at 4 °C and labeled with 1 μg/ml of the FITC anti-human CD45 antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) per 10^7 cells for 20 min at 4 °C. CD45+ cells were isolated using the EasySepTM FITC Positive Selection Kit (StemCell Technologies).	Viable immune (CD45+ Hoechst−) single-cell suspensions generated from ccRCC tumor samples and blood were FACS sorted on a FACS ARIA sorter (BD Biosciences) for lymphoid and myeloid cells (ratio 3:1).  The cells were sorted into ice-cold 1x PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine-serum albumin (New England BioLabs). Sorted cells were counted and viability as assessed using the MoxiGoII counter (Orflo Technologies). Single cells were re-suspended at 1000 cells/ul with a viability > 90%	Alternatively, mononuclear cells from whole peripheral blood of paired subjects were isolated using SepMate Tubes (StemCell Technologies) by density gradient centrifugation. Cells were then viably frozen in 5% DMSO in RPMI complemented with 95% FBS. Cryopreserved cells were resuscitated for flow cytometry analyses by rapid thawing and slow dilution.	Single-cell library preparation was carried out as per the 10× Genomics Chromium Single-Cell 5′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2. Cell suspensions were loaded onto a Chromium Single-Cell Chip along with the reverse transcription (RT) master mix and single-cell 5′ gel beads, aiming for 7500 cells per channel. Following generation of single-cell gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs), RT was performed using a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA); 13 cycles were used for cDNA amplification. Amplified cDNA was purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) as per the manufacturer’s recommended parameters. Post-cDNA amplification reaction QC and quantification was performed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the DNA High Sensitivity chip. For input into the gene expression library construction, 50 ng cDNA and 14 cycles was used.	Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using a 150-pair-end sequencing kit. Gene expression FASTQ files were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) using the Cell Ranger v2.2 pipeline, while clonotype sequencing was aligned to the vdj_GRCh38_alts_ensembl genome build provided by the manufacturer.
