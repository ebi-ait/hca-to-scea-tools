Investigation Title	Cells of the adult human heart

Experiment Description	Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require deeper understanding of the healthy heart’s molecular processes. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavor. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and nuclei transcriptomes, we characterise six anatomical adult heart regions (left/right atria and ventricles, apex, interventricular septum). Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, revealing distinct atrial and ventricular subsets with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment we identify cardiac resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Further, inference of cell-cell interactions highlight different macrophage-fibroblast-cardiomyocyte networks between atria and ventricles that are distinct from skeletal muscle.  We expect this reference human cardiac cell atlas to advance mechanistic studies of heart homeostasis and disease.

Protocol Description		Tissue is acquired from UK and North American  donors (D1-7 and 11, H2-7) after circulatory death (DCD: D2, D4-7 and D11) and after brain death (DBD: D1, D3, H2-7). For UK DCD donors after a  five minute stand-off and for DBD, the chest is opened, the aorta is cross-clamped  and cardiac samples are acquired. For North American DBD donors, the aorta is cross-clamped, cold cardioplegia (Celsior) is administered under pressure via the aorta to arrest beating, the heart is excised, rinsed in cold saline and samples acquired. All donor samples are full-thickness myocardial biopsies from LA, RA, RV, SP, AX and LVs, with intentional exclusion of large epicardial fat deposits. Samples used for single nuclei isolation are flash-frozen and stored at -80°C. Single cell isolation and CD45+ enrichment is carried out on freshly collected samples. 	 Single nuclei are obtained from flash-frozen tissues using mechanical homogenization as previously described. Tissues are homogenized using a 7 ml glass Dounce tissue grinder set (Merck) with 8-10 strokes of a loose pestle (A) and 8-10 strokes of a tight pestle (B) in homogenization buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1x Protease Inhibitor, 0.4 U/µl RNaseIn, 0.2 U/µl SUPERaseIn, 0.1% Triton X-100 in nuclease-free water). Homogenate is filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer (Corning).	After centrifugation (500×g, 5 min, 4 °C) the supernatant is removed and the pellet is resuspended in storage buffer (1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2 U/µl Protector RNaseIn). Nuclei are stained with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagents (ThermoFisher) and Hoechst-positive single nuclei are purified by fluorescent activated cell sorting using Influx, XDP or FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Nuclei purification and integrity is verified under microscope		Libraries were prepared according to 10X standard protocols
