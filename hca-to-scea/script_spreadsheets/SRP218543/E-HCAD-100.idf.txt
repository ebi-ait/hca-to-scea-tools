Investigation Title	Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals profibrotic roles of distinct epithelial and mesenchymal lineages in pulmonary fibrosis
Comment[Submitted Name]	PulmonaryFibrosisGSE135893
Experiment Description	Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a form of chronic lung disease characterized by progressive destruction of normal alveolar gas-exchange surfaces and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). In order to comprehensively define the cell types, mechanisms and mediators driving ECM deposition and fibrotic remodeling in lungs with pulmonary fibrosis, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of single-cell suspensions generated from non-fibrotic control and PF lungs. Analysis of over 114,000 cells from 20 PF and 10 control lungs identified 31 distinct cell types. We identified multiple distinct lineages directly contribute to ECM expansion, including a novel HAS1hi fibroblast subtype and a previously undescribed KRT5-/KRT17+, collagen and ECM-producing epithelial cell population that was highly enriched in PF lungs. Together these data provide high-resolution insights into the basic mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis, and indicate a direct profibrotic role of the lung epithelium in PF pathogenesis. Overall design: We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of single-cell suspensions generated from non-fibrotic control and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) lungs

Protocol Description	PF tissue samples were obtained from lungs removed at the time of lung transplantation at two lung transplant centers (VUMC and NTI). Nonfibrotic control tissue samples were obtained from lungs declined for organ donation. For PF lungs, diagnoses were determined according to ATS/ERS consensus criteria (1). All studies were approved by the local Institutional Review Boards (Vanderbilt IRB #’s 060165, 171657, Western IRB # 20181836).	Biopsies of multiple regions from each lung sample were digested in an enzymatic cocktail (collagenase I/dispase II 1 μg/ml tissue or Miltenyi Multi-Tissue Dissociation Kit) using a gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi, Inc).	Tissue lysates were serially filtered through sterile gauze, 100 um then 40 um sterile filters (Fischer). Single cell suspensions underwent cell sorting using serial columns at VUMC. A combination of two subsequent separations is applied to isolate cell subsets that can be distinguished from other cell types through their expression of two different markers. This includes cell types for which a specific marker has not been defined. CD45- and C45+ populations were mixed 2:1 in samples processed at VUMC and were used as input for generation of scRNA-seq libraries.	Tissue lysates were serially filtered through sterile gauze, 100 um then 40 um sterile filters (Fischer). Single cell suspensions then underwent FACS at Tgen.	ScRNA-seq libraries were generated using the 10X Chromium platform 5’ v2 library preparation kits (10X Genomics) following the manufacturer's recommendations and targeting 5,000-10,000 cells per sample.		Next generation sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000.	Next generation sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.	Next generation sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500.
